ensure that look up tables are resistant to being converted to a symbolic expression by something like C3,
Ensure that function substitutions can occur, note a 32 bit of entropy of a function that operates on standard integers. It's likely unique among 32 bit functions because the look up table for such a function would be 32× two to the 32×2 to the 32, and the LUT space certainly does not collide for 32 bits of complexity of function.
Best bet is probably making sure LUT's are very hard to reverse, possibly by using high entropy functions

how can a non-prohibitively large LUT encode a nontrivial function (>64 bits?)
needs to operate on > 3 bit inputs (i.e. 2^3*2^3*3) for the LUT
